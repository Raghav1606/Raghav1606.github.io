I am a software analyst at Goldman Sachs, working in the GS Electronic Trading platforms team under global markets division. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science (Hons.) in Computer Engineering from the Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi University in 2019.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research intern in MIDAS lab, IIIT-Delhi, under the guidance of Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah in the domain of natural language processing focussing on the problem of hate speech detection in code switched languages. Under the guidance of Prof. Preeti Kaur at NSIT, I further delved into the problem of hate-speech detection from images and twiiter pages, which was submitted as a part of B.Tech project thesis. With a keen interest in the world of NLP, I also worked on understading and creating dependency based embeddings for hindi texts and comparing their performance with other embeddings available.

I have a rich technical experience of 2+ yrs as a software developer at Goldman Sachs, where my role is mainly concerned with developing microstructure applications that facilitates low latency trading for institutional clients. Over time, I have also developed exprtise in scalable and distributed systems, system design (HLD and LLD), socket programming and backend application development. 

Previously, I have had experience in competitive programming and worked as a freelance problem contributor at hackerearth - creating official programming challenges and a few others for recuitment contests.
