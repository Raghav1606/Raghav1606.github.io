I am a software analyst at Goldman Sachs, working in the GS Electronic Trading platforms team under global markets division. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science (Hons.) in Computer Engineering from the Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi University in 2019.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research intern in MIDAS lab, IIIT-Delhi, under the guidance of Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah in the domain of natural language processing focussing on the problem of hate speech detection in code switched languages. I worked on two publications and also preseented my paper at AAAI-19, Hawaii. Intrigued  by the plethora of opportunities in NLP, especially non-english texts and the drive to enhance the models, I started working on understading and creating dependency based embeddings for hindi texts and comparing their performance with other embeddings available. Also, under the guidance of Prof. Preeti Kaur at NSIT, I further deep dived into the problem of hate-speech detection from images and twiiter pages, bifurcating text and images to obtain optimal results, and submitted as a part of B.Tech project thesis. I am super excited to continue my work in the domain of NLP with the ultimate goal to eradicate the illicit behaviour that continues to dominate the social media (including cyber bullying and social prejudices)

I have a rich technical experience of 2+ yrs as a software developer at Goldman Sachs, where my role is mainly concerned with developing microstructure applications that facilitates low latency trading for institutional clients. Over time, I have also developed exprtise in scalable and distributed systems, system design (HLD and LLD), socket programming and backend application development. 

Previously, I have had experience in competitive programming and worked as a freelance problem contributor at hackerearth - creating official programming challenges and a few others for recuitment contests. I have also interned at Sandrock e-Technologies, where I got hands on experience in java development.
