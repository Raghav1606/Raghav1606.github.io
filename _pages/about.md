<i>"My Heart is in the Work" - Andrew Carnegie</i>

<b>On a hunt for data science, machine learning and software engineering Internship roles for <u>Summer 2023</u>, where I can contribute intellectually to solve challenging problems :) !!!</b>

Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](https://raghav1606.github.io/files/resume.pdf)

I'm Raghav Kapoor and I am currently studying at Carnegie Mellon University, School of Computer Science (Language Technologies Institute) as a masters student focussing on intelligent information systems. I'm orignially from New Delhi, India and currently based out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I'm diving deep in the ML/NLP space with a special focus on integrating it to large scaled systems. I'm interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Software Development. I firmly believe that my passion, hard work and leadership skills shall empower me to create a meaningful impact on humanity through technology.

Before joining CMU, I worked as a software analyst at Goldman Sachs for 3 years, in the GS Electronic Trading platforms team under global markets division. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science (Hons.) in Computer Engineering from the Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi University in 2019.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research intern in MIDAS lab, IIIT-Delhi, under the guidance of Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah in the domain of natural language processing focussing on the problem of hate speech detection in code switched languages. I worked on two publications and also presented my paper at AAAI-19, Hawaii. Intrigued  by the plethora of opportunities in NLP, especially non-english texts and the drive to enhance the models, I started working on creating dependency based embeddings for hindi texts and comparing their performance with other pre-trained embeddings. Under the guidance of Prof. Preeti Kaur at NSIT, I also deep dived into the problem of hate-speech detection from images and twiiter pages, bifurcating text and images to obtain optimal results.

I have a rich technical experience of 3 yrs as a software developer at Goldman Sachs, where my role was mainly concentrated on building and managing nanosecond latency systems that facilitates equities and options trading for institutional clients. Over time, I have also developed exprtise in scalable and distributed systems, system design (HLD and LLD), socket programming, Java, C++, Python and backend application development.
